virus2spread virus distribution model-simulation

Here arises an attempt to test DR Clare Craig's hypothesis about airborne virus contagion -> Book Expired.
<br> 
To investigate annually recurring waves from the momentum of a chaotic system, and study or play with it's dynamics.
<br> 
Since the linear sientific SIR model used, seems to differ from reality.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
 Reproduction is not yet implemented - a long way to go.
<br> For maximal Iteration speed minimize the render Simulation Window to the Taskbar.

<br>Installation:
<br>Prerequisite: Microsoft .Net 8 has to be installed first! https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
<br>
<br>Download the ![Virus2SpreadSetup.msi](https://github.com/gitfrid/virus2spread/blob/d736787e9ee451ff964ddb6c1980e214b5921de7/virus2spreadSetup/Release/virus2spreadSetup.msi) to install the Software.
<br>form the github folder ![virus2spreadSetup/Release/](https://github.com/gitfrid/virus2spread/blob/d736787e9ee451ff964ddb6c1980e214b5921de7/virus2spreadSetup/Release/virus2spreadSetup.msi)

<br>Alternative, it is  sufficient if only the binary files are copied fom this github folder: 
<br>/Virus2spread/bin/Release/net8.0-windows7.0/*.*  to any folder, and double click Virus2spread.exe to run the Simulation.
