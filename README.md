virus2spread virus distribution model-simulation

Here arises an attempt to test DR Clare Craig's hypothesis about airborne virus contagion -> Book Expired.
<br> 
To investigate annually recurring waves from the momentum of a chaotic system, and study or play with it's dynamics.
<br> 
Since the linear sientific SIR model used, seems to differ from reality.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
 Reproduction is not yet implemented - a long way to go.
<br> For maximal Iteration speed minimize the render Simulation Window to the Taskbar.
<br>
<br>Installation:
<br>Prerequisite: Microsoft .Net 8 has to be installed first! https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
<br>Download the Setup.exe and the Virus2SpreadSetup.msi form the github folder /virus2spreadSetup/Release/ to install the Software.
<br>
<br>Alternatively, it is  sufficient if only the binary files are copied fom this github folder: 
<br>..\Virus2spread\bin\Release\net8.0-windows7.0\*.*  to any folder, and then doubleclick Virus2spread.exe to run the Simulation.
