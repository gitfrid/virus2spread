virus2spread virus distribution model-simulation

Here arises an attempt to test DR Clare Craig's hypothesis about airborne virus contagion -> Book Expired.
<br> 
To investigate annually recurring waves from the momentum of a chaotic system, and study or play with it's dynamics.
<br> 
Since the linear sientific SIR model used, seems to differ from reality.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
 Reproduction is not yet implemented - a long way to go.
<br> For maximal Iteration speed minimize teh Render Window to the Taskbar.
