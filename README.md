**virus2spread virus distribution model-simulation**

Here arises an attempt to test DR Clare Craig's hypothesis about airborne virus contagion -> Book Expired.
<br> 
To investigate annually recurring waves from the momentum of a chaotic system, and study or play with it's dynamics.
<br> 
Since the linear sientific SIR model used, seems to differ from reality.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Further information see ![virus2spread wiki](https://github.com/gitfrid/virus2spread/wiki)
<br> 
 Reproduction is not yet implemented - a long way to go.
<br>For maximal Iteration speed minimize the render Simulation Window to the Windows Taskbar.

<br>
<br>Alternative, it is  sufficient if only the binary files are copied fom this github folder: 
<br>/Virus2spread/bin/Release/net8.0-windows7.0/*.*  to any folder, and double click Virus2spread.exe to run the Simulation.

<br>**Attention!!!**
<br>A security prompt **"The computer has been protected by Windows"** or **"The publisher is unknown"** appears, when you first run the setup or the software.
This is because the software is not digitally signed, i.e. the publisher of the software is unknown and not officially certified.
